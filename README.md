## 🚀 About Me

I'm Denton — a curious builder, lifelong learner, and human behind the keyboard. Coding has not only started to shape my career but it has also helped me discover my passion for helping people. My love for coding traces back to my youth where I was captivated by the idea of creating something out of nothing.

Over the last 8 years, I have developed many professional and personal projects. Each project has honed my skills in problem-solving, team work, and innovation, enabling me to turn complex challenges into simple, impactful solutions that benefit others.

But more than that, I’m a husband, a thinker, and someone who believes that work should serve a purpose greater than the task list.
